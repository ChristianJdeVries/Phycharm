Basic Track Assessment 25-01-2021 by Christian de Vries

Steps to run the program:
1. start nutritional_values.py (any needed files will be generated and nutritional_values.csv
already contains the nutritional values of some ingredients)
2. answer the questions as they come up
3. output is in output.txt

What I learned:
I learned the basics of programming. More specifically, I learned how programs work
and how to write simple programs. Besides, I learned how frustrating it is when your program
doesn't work and how satisfying it is when it does work.

What I would like to learn:
To be able to make programs that are related to my studies (programmes related to economics
or finance). Furthermore, I would like to be able to program faster and make more complicated
programs.

Advanced track:
I would like to do the advanced track in block 2b.
